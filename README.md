# BitcoinP2P

This project started as an assignment from the IOHK "Haskell and Cryptocurrencies"

summer course held in Athens July-September 2017.

We would in particular like to thank our instructors:

  Lars Brünjes, from IOHK  https://iohk.io/

  Andres Löh, from Well-Typed The Haskell Consultants http://www.well-typed.com/

for motivating, helping us and inspiring us with

their love and passion about haskell.

Of course, we are to blame for any mistakes.

In this project we mainly focus on implementing part of the bitcoin protocol,

communicating with other Nodes and using Haskell. For now, we do not care a lot

about scallability, robustness, speed or readability.
